## Usage

Let's pretend you want to create a Django project called "therock". Rather than using `startproject` and then editing the results to include your name, email, and various configuration issues that always get forgotten until the worst possible moment, get cookiecutter to do all the work.

Follow the Quick Start above.

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a Django project will be created for you.

Answer the prompts with your own desired options. For example:

    project_name [My Project]: The Rock
    author_name [ThinkNimble]: Test Author
    email [hello@thinknimble.com]: test@thinknimble.com
    project_slug [the_rock]:
    Select mail_service:
    1 - Mailgun
    2 - Amazon SES
    3 - Custom SMTP
    Choose from 1, 2, 3 [1]: 1
    Select client_app:
    1 - Vue3
    2 - React
    3 - None
    Choose from 1, 2, 3 [1]: 1
    Error: "my_project" directory already exists
    william@Williams-MacBook-Pro thinknimble % rm -rf my_project 
    william@Williams-MacBook-Pro thinknimble % cookiecutter git@github.com:thinknimble/tn-spa-cookiecutter.git --checkout cleanup
    You've downloaded /Users/william/.cookiecutters/tn-spa-cookiecutter before. Is it okay to delete and re-download it? [yes]: 
    project_name [My Project]: 
    author_name [ThinkNimble]: 
    email [hello@thinknimble.com]: 
    project_slug [my_project]: 
    Select mail_service:
    1 - Mailgun
    2 - Amazon SES
    3 - Custom SMTP
    Choose from 1, 2, 3 [1]: 
    Select client_app:
    1 - Vue3
    2 - None
    Choose from 1, 2 [1]: 

Create a git repo and push it there::

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first awesome commit"
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:thinknimble/the-rock.git
git push -u origin main 
```

Now take a look at your repo. Don't forget to carefully look at the generated README. Awesome, right?
