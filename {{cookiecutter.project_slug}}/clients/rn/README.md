This starter is a collection of libraries and approaches needed for fast start and productive maintainance of Expo (React Native) App.

## Getting Started

## ios local build 
npx expo install expo-modules-core@0.9.0

unset LDFLAGS && \                      
unset NVM_CD_FLAGS && \
unset CPPFLAGS && \
unset DEBUG_FORTRANFLAGS && \
unset CXXFLAGS && \
unset DEBUG_CXXFLAGS && \
unset DEBUG_FFLAGS && \
unset FORTRANFLAGS && \
unset CFLAGS && \
unset DEBUG_CFLAGS && \
unset LDFLAGS && \
unset FFLAGS

## Environments 

Build environments are different from the typical environments we think of

When running locally NODE_ENV='development'
When a version is published or updated NODE_ENV='production'

### Configuration and env variables 

All config variables for the various environments come from .env file in mobile directory
Env variables defined in eas.json are not available to npx run start (local)
Instead the variables are declared in package.json

#### Quick start with [cli-rn](https://github.com/kanzitelli/cli-rn)

```bash
npx cli-rn new app
```

In order to change app's name, please make necessary changes in `app.json`.

## What's inside

- [Expo SDK](https://github.com/expo/expo) - a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms.
- [React Navigation (v6)](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation) - routing and navigation for React Native apps.
- [Navio](https://github.com/kanzitelli/rn-navio) - universal navigation library for React Native. Built on top of [React Navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation).
- [RN UI lib](https://github.com/wix/react-native-ui-lib) - amazing Design System, UI toolset & components library for React Native. Dark Mode is implemented using this library.
- [Reanimated 2](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated) - React Native's Animated library reimplemented.
- [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) - simple, scalable state management, with [mobx-persist-store](https://github.com/quarrant/mobx-persist-store) for persisting your stores.
- [Flash List](https://github.com/Shopify/flash-list) - a better list for React Native (by Shopify).
- [React Native Gesture Handler](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-gesture-handler) - native touches and gesture system for React Native.

#### Native libraries

In order to use them, you will need to run `yarn prebuild` command to generate `ios/` and `android/` folders with native code.

- [MMKV](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv) - efficient, small mobile key-value storage framework developed by WeChat. [~30x faster](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv#benchmark) than _AsyncStorage_! Available only within Expo dev clients. Instructions on installation could be found [here](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv#expo).
- [Fast Image](https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image) - performant React Native image component.

#### Extra helpful libraries

- [Release It](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) - automate versioning and publishing of your app.

#### Useful services/methods

- `navio` - a service that exposes all navigation methods of [Navio](https://github.com/kanzitelli/rn-navio) instance.
- `translate` - a service that brings an easy integration of localization for an app by using [i18n-js](https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js) and [expo-localization](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/expo-localization).
- `api` - a service where API-related methods are located.
- `onStart` - a service where you can write your own logic when app is launched. For example, you can increment number of `appLaunches` there.

#### Design system

This starter is using [RN UI lib](https://github.com/wix/react-native-ui-lib) as a design system, UI toolset and a source of ready-to-go components.

`configureDesignSystem()` - a method where all settings for an app's design system is taking place. You can customize colors, schemes, typegraphy, spacings, etc. Located at `src/utils/designSystem.tsx`.

## Advantages

#### Describe app layout in one place (w/ [Navio](https://github.com/kanzitelli/rn-navio))

All setup for your screens, tabs and modals take place in one file `src/screens/index.ts`.

```tsx
import {Navio} from 'rn-navio';

// importing screen components
import {Main} from './main';
import {Playground} from './playground';
import {Settings} from './settings';
import {Example} from './_screen-sample';

// building layout
export const navio = Navio.build({
  screens: {
    Main,
    Settings,
    Example,
    Playground: {
      component: Playground,
      options: () => ({
        title: 'Playground',
      }),
    },
  },
  stacks: {
    MainStack: ['Main', 'Example'],
    ExampleStack: ['Example'],
  },
  tabs: {
    MainTab: {
      stack: 'MainStack',
      options: {
        title: 'Home',
      },
    },
    PlaygroundTab: {
      stack: ['Playground'],
      options: () => ({
        title: 'Playground',
      }),
    },
    SettingsTab: {
      stack: ['Settings'],
      options: () => ({
        title: 'Settings',
      }),
    },
  },
  modals: {
    ExampleModal: 'ExampleStack',
  },
  root: 'Tabs',
  hooks: [useAppearance],
  options: {
    stack: screenDefaultOptions,
    tab: tabDefaultOptions,
  },
});

export const AppRoot = navio.Root;
```

#### Navigate with predictability

```tsx
export const Screen = () => {
  const {navio} = useServices();

  return (
    <View>
      <Button
        label="Push Settings"
        onPress={() => {
          // Typescript and IDE will help with autocompletion
          navio.push('Settings');
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
};
```

#### Dark mode support

You can define modes in `utils/designSystem.tsx`.

#### Samples for new screens, services, stores and components.

So you have one structure within the project. You can find them in corresponding folders. Just copy&paste it and make the necessary changes.

## Enhancements

There are still some things I would like to add to the starter:

- [x] Auth flow [example](https://github.com/kanzitelli/expo-starter/issues/14#issuecomment-1020730141)
- [x] [Navigation library](https://github.com/kanzitelli/rn-navio) to reduce boilerplate code.
- [ ] Shared transitions

Feel free to open an issue for suggestions.

## Why

...do we need yet another starter/boilerplate? Well, I work with React Native for more than 4 years and during the time I started having my own project structure which was a good fit for almost all of the delivered apps. Also, I have come up with some custom [useful services/methods](#useful-servicesmethods) which simplify usage of [React Navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation) and other libraries. Check out [Advantages](#advantages) section.
