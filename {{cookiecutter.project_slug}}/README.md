## Setup

### Django App
1. Install Postgres (OSX - `brew install postgresql`; Linux - `apt-get`)
1. Copy .env.example to new file .env 
1. Run `./init-db.sh` from the `scripts` directory (or view and manually create the database)

Once db credentials are set:
1. run `pipenv install` to install dependencies 
1. run `pipenv shell` to activate the pipenv shell
1. run `python manage.py migrate` to migrate database
1. run `python manage.py runserver` to run the Django API (default - localhost:8000/admin)


### Frontend
See the [frontend README](client/README.md)


### Favicon Setup


The Django app is already configured to serve favorite icons for all browsers and platforms (include, for example, apple-icons and android-icons at various sizes). By default, this icon is the vue/react logo.

***Note your image must be a square otherwise a white bg will appear because the file is cropped if it is not a square go to [iloveimg.com](https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image) and resize it.*** 
Visit [realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) and upload a high resolution, square version of the image you would like to use as the favicon for this app.

Download the ZIP file of icons that the site generates for you and paste them in the `client/public/static/favicons/` directory.

When we run collectstatic the public folder is copied as is and enables serving of the favicons
